# ThirdYearProject

## The Idea
The software will consist of two parts: the generic tool and learning tool. The generic tool is aimed at users with more experience with graph colouring who want to check their graphs are valid and have the minimum chromatic number. The learning tool is aimed at users with no/ very little experience in graph colouring, but with experience in basic graph theory.
### Generic Tool
The generic tool part of the software will allow users to freely use the graphing tool. The graphing tool allows the user to create coloured graphs which can be tested to see if they are valid and if they have the minimum chromatic number. Users can also save and load their graphs, as well as use example graphs which I would provide to demonstrate graph colouring in well-known graphs (butterfly, diamond...).
### Learning Tool
Learning Tool
The learning tool part of the software is targeted at users who are new to graph colouring and want to learn about it. This will consist of interactive lessons/ tutorials and once they feel comfortable with the concept they can test their knowledge with an interactive quiz. If this software were used in education, a score recording feature could be added to track students progress.
## Existing Systems
Similar software has been created by Vlad-Florin Chitaru of the University of Manchester (http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/library/3rd-year-projects/2016/vlad-florin.chitaru.pdf).This software demonstrates the different graph colouring algorithms and compares the different algorithms in terms of time complexity. This software assumes the user has a basic understanding of graph colouring and graph colouring algorithms. Rather than a learning tool, this software is heavily based on comparing different graph colouring algorithms and generating reports on the algorithms time complexity.

More generically there is software such as UnitWalk and ColPack used for graph colouring. These are generally used for benchmarking different graph colouring algorithms and are aimed at users who are experienced in graph colouring (and in some cases experience in programming).

## Why is This Software Needed?
Whilst there are other graph colouring tools in existence, openly available software is generally for users with experience in graph colouring. My system is aimed at users who want to learn about graph colouring from a beginner standpoint with an easy to use interface which is graphical and has no complex code/ large learning curves. The system will also be aimed at users who are somewhat experienced in graph colouring who would like to learn by using the software freely by creating their own graphs in an easy to use graphical interface. This is a niche gap in the market which could help people wanting to learn about graph colouring who enjoy learning in more of a practical domain rather than reading.
