# ThirdYearProject
Developing a Graph Colouring Testing Tool

# The Idea
The software will consist of two parts: the generic tool and learning tool. The generic tool is aimed at users with more experience with graph colouring who want to check their graphs are valid and have the minimum chromatic number. The learning tool is aimed at users with no/ very little experience in graph colouring, but with experience in basic graph theory.
## Generic Tool
The generic tool part of the software will allow users to freely use the graphing tool. The graphing tool allows the user to create coloured graphs which can be tested to see if they are valid and if they have the minimum chromatic number. Users can also save and load their graphs, as well as use example graphs which I would provide to demonstrate graph colouring in well-known graphs (butterfly, diamond...).
